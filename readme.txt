Assignment 4 -- Bresenham's Line Algorithm for Integers

Summary:

For this assignment, we are tasked to edit the bresenham.cpp file to implement 
	Bresenham's algorithm in Integer Math only. A makefile is provided to
	compile the .cpp file easier. To run the program, simpl type in make 
	to compile the file first, and type in "./bresenham" afterwards to load the
	executable.

	Pixels are being rasterized on the screen, along with te approximation'
	of the line in integer arithmetic. If a line has started at point x,y
	with its endpoint in x',y', doing the reverse will render the same line
	for this program. 
	
	Everything should be working fine, although there might have been some
	missed test cases I wasn't aware of using.
